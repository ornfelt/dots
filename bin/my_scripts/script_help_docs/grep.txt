Find words that start with f and end with x (for example fox fix):
grep "f.x" file.txt

Or to to find fooooox, falx, fx etc:
grep "f.*x" file.txt

To exclude finding fx:
grep "f\+x" file.txt

Find lines that end with x:
grep "x$" file.txt

Find lines that start with sp:
grep "^sp" file.txt

Match boomer, zoomer, doomer:
grep ".oomer" file.txt

Match boomer, zoomer, doomer, a coomer, the consoomer (only the oomer-word):
grep "\S*oomer" file.txt

Match the consoomer and the       consoomer:
grep "the\s\+consoomer" file.txt

Match url's (Finds http and https):
grep "https\?" file.txt

Match url's (Finds http and https and then prints until whitespace):
grep "https\?://\S*" file.txt

Match url's (Finds http and https and then prints until whitespace and until dot):
grep "https\?://\S*\." file.txt

Match url's (Finds http and https and then prints until whitespace and until dot, and then print until non characters (lowercase)):
grep "https\?://\S*\.[a-z]\+" file.txt

Match url's (Finds http and https and then prints until whitespace and until dot, and then print until non characters and then include until whitespace):
grep "https\?://\S*\.[A-Za-z]\+\S*" file.txt

Example for finding mail:
grep "\S\+@\S\+\.[A-Za-z]\+" file.txt
The above matches: non whitespace characters, then @, then more non whitespace characters, then real dot (\.), then any letters (+) for any number of those). Only letters mean that it wont find the paranthesis in this example: jonas@jonas.se (my address).

Find line that begins with capital letter:
grep "^[A-Z]" file.txt

Find line that begins AND ENDS with capital letter:
grep "^[A-Z].*[A-Z]$" file.txt
